TODO:
 2. restart/new game button
 3. Add screen resolution options?
 4. (optional) add background color/train color options
 5. rework start screen
 6. optimize text for widescreen(make responsive to height as well as width with a max_size-function?)
 7. optimize number-box-sizes to make them scale to wide and tall windows(use width AND height for scaling)
 8. continue documentation

IDEAS:
title/text-scaling: max width, max height, check how font size behaves
maybe make a text-class or new text-functions in position (using width and height/CW, CH again instead of size
select color scheme, background color etc, greyscale option?
draw a letter on trains so their color isn't the only distinguishable feature (colorblindness friendly design)

make Positioning an interface, make trainPositioning and gridPositioning?
style trains more?
